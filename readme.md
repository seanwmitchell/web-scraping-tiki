The course is 3 months long and focused on Artficial Intelligence and Machine Learning. More info [here](https://bootcamp.coderschool.vn/ml/)

### This project

This project relates to our second week on the course. It brings together all the concepts we learnt in the last week.

This week we learnt:
+ Sort algorithms
+ Object orientated programming
+ Regex and string manipulation
+ Relational database concepts
+ The SQL language and PostgreSQL database

### Technologies used

The project is written in :snake: Python.

The following libraries were used:
+ Flask
    + A commonly used Python library to serve dynamic web applications.
+ Datetime
    + A built in Python library that we used in the project to calculate a delta. Which is the time difference between two timestamps.
+ Requests
    + A Python library that downloads a file from the internet over the http or https protocol. In this project we used it to download a HTML file into memory.
+ BeautifulSoup
    + A Python library that can parse through complex documents or code, like an XML or HTML file for content. This content can then be used in code or saved into a database for later use.
+ Psycopg2
    + A library in Python that is used to connect to a PostgreSQL database.
